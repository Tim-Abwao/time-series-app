Trend,"The general upward(increase) or downward(decrease) progression in the data points."
Time Series,"A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. For example, daily sales totals over a reasonably lenghthy period constitute a time series."
Seasonality,"This refers to variations that occur at specific regular intervals e.g. every weekend, month-end or festive period."
Cyclic patterns,"These are the rises and falls in the data that occur at flexible periods, usually extending a year and mostly due to economic factors."
Stationarity,"A stationary time series is one which has constant mean and variance."
Auto-Regressive(AR) model,"A model which expresses the time series as a function of its own past values. Previous values serve as the explanatory variables, and their number is the order of the model, usually denoted by p."
Moving Average(MA) Model,"A model which specifies that a value depends on the current, and various previous values, of the random error terms. The number of error terms in an MA model, usually denoted by q, is its order."
ARMA,"An Auto-Regressive Moving Average model combines the concepts of the AR and MA models, to better simulate a relatively stationary time series."
